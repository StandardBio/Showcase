GBM features many biological challenges, such as multiclonal heterogeneity driving aggressive growth and invasion, complex interactions with immune cells, both resident and infiltrating, and expression of key drivers like Epidermal Growth Receptor Factor (EGFR) and other transcription factors. Visualizing these features withing the GBM tissue is critical to understand tumor biology for informed therapeutic strategies.\n\nDemonstrated rendered images of GBM were generated from Imaging Mass Cytometry data acquired from GBM's sample. The GBM sample was stained with 43-marker antibody panel. The whole tissue was visualized on the Hyperion XTi Imaging System in Tissue Mode.
