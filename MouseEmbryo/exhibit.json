The tissue scan was performed in hours. Expression of neuronal-specific markers was observed in the developing brain as well as along the spinal column. Several stromal compartments were identified with combinatorial expression of several stromal markers. The epidermis and hypodermis are visualized and differentiated by the expression of specific epithelial and stromal markers. Organ-specific tissue compartments were also highlighted. In the lungs, specific bronchiolar and alveolar tissue compartments can be observed. In the heart, the expression of vasculature-specific markers and cell replication markers is detected. In the liver, high expression of cell replication markers and the presence of Kupffer cells is observed. In the colon, epithelial tissue and surrounding smooth muscle are highlighted. ",
